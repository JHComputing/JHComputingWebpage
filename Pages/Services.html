                    <h2>Component Sales</h2>
                    <p>Computer components are the building blocks of any computer system, working together to perform various tasks and operations. From the central processing unit (CPU) that acts as the brain of the computer to the memory modules (RAM) that temporarily store data, each component plays a crucial role in the overall functionality of the system.
    
                        Key components include the motherboard, which serves as the main circuit board connecting all other components, and the storage devices such as hard disk drives (HDDs) or solid-state drives (SSDs) where data is permanently stored.
                        
                        Graphics processing units (GPUs) handle graphical computations and are essential for gaming and multimedia applications, while input/output (I/O) devices like keyboards, mice, and monitors allow users to interact with the computer.
                        
                        Understanding the functions and capabilities of each component is essential for building and maintaining a reliable and efficient computer system.</p>
